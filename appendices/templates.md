If the README has many more badges, you might want to consider using a table for badges: [see this example](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). Such a table should be more wide than high. (Note that the badge for pyOpenSci peer-review will be provided upon acceptance.)

- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Any additional setup required (authentication tokens, etc)
- [ ] Brief demonstration usage
- [ ] Direction to more detailed documentation (e.g. your documentation files or website).
- [ ] If applicable, how the package compares to other similar packages and/or how it relates to other packages
- [ ] Citation information

#### Usability
Reviewers are encouraged to submit suggestions (or pull requests) that will improve the usability of the package as a whole.

#### For packages co-submitting to JOSS

- [ ] The package has an **obvious research application** according to JOSS's definition in their [submission requirements](http://joss.theoj.org/about#submission_requirements).

*Note:* Be sure to check this carefully, as JOSS's submission requirements and scope differ from pyOpenSci's in terms of what types of packages are accepted.

The package contains a `paper.md` matching [JOSS's requirements](http://joss.theoj.org/about#paper_structure) with:

- [ ] **A short summary** describing the high-level functionality of the software

## Review Request Template

Editors may make use of the e-mail template below in recruiting reviewers:

Dear [REVIEWER],

Hi, this is [EDITOR]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a package for pyOpenSci. As you probably know, pyOpenSci conducts peer review of Python packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals.

The package, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [ONBOARDING ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (Weâ€™ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.)

Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a package review, and includes links to example reviews. Our standards are detailed in our [packaging guide], and we provide reviewer [template] for you to use. Please make sure you do not have a conflict of interest preventing you from reviewing this package. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me.

{IF APPLICABLE: The authors have also chosen to jointly submit their package to the Journal of Open Source Software, so this package includes a short `paper.md` manuscript describing the software that we ask you include in your review.}

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to
review at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]

<IF JOSS SUBMISSION>
This package is going to move on to JOSS for review. I believe @arfon will ask you to implement the items below but let's let him chime in here first! 
- [ ] Activate Zenodo watching the repo
- [ ] Tag and create a release so as to create a Zenodo version and DOI
- [ ] Submit to JOSS using the Zenodo DOI. We will tag it for expedited review.

< short greeting />

I'm writing to see if you'd be interested in participating with pyOpenSci, a new community around improving the quality of software in the scientific python stack.

pyOpenSci provides resources, mentoring, and documentation for making scientific python packages more useful and maintainable. It builds off of the successful rOpenSci model, with a Python flavor. It primarily coordinates a review process by which experienced developers in the scientific python ecosystem can provide feedback and suggestions to other (usually fairly small) packages.

You've been in the scientific Python community for some time now, and I think you'd be a great part of the pyOpenSci community. Would you be interested in joining us? Participation can be as small or large as you wish - for example, you could submit your own package for review in pyOpenSci, offer to be a reviewer of someone else's package, or begin attending pyOpenSci planning meetings as we build and refine our processes. We'd just be happy to have you around :-)

< short goodbye />
