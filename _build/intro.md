# The pyOpenSci Dev Guide

This is the development guide for pyOpenSci!

If you've found this, please note that it is still an early draft. There may be mistakes. pyOpenSci is not yet operational, but hopefully will be ready to accept submissions soon.

## Why pyOpenSci?
pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through peer-review of scientific Python packages. We also build technical capacity by providing a curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community among scientific Python users so that we can help each other become better programmers and researchers.

## This Guide
This guidebook contains information for pyOpenSci package authors, reviewers, and editors. It is organized into three sections:

### 1. Before Review - Packaging Guide
Contains our guidelines for creating and testing scientific python packages. Before submitting a package for review, check to be sure that your software meets the basic [requirements](). The section also contains recommendations and best practices that might be helpful as you are writing and preparing your pakcage.

### 2. Peer Review Process
Outlines the pyOpenSci peer review process. This includes guidelines for submitting and reviewing packages, as well as our [Code of Conduct](). [Aims and Scope]() section lays out what types of packages we are able to review. If you are unsure whether your package fits, we encourage you to submit a [presubmission inquiry]()

### 3. After Review - Maintenance
Provides tips and advice for maintaining and promoting your pyOpenSci package after the review process has finished.

## Improving this Guide
The pyOpenSci guidebook is a living document hosted on GitHub. If you have suggestions for improvements, create an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/dev_guide).
